<br />
<br />

6) And yeah that's it you have the extension ready to use. I do recommend pinning it in the extension tab for accessing it quickly.

* **NOTE : In case class links change or link updates for those which haven't yet come , I will update them as soon as they change, you just have to fetch the latest update, everything else will be taken care of automatically unless you do something funky with the directory or the code**
